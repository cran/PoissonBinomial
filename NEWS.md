# PoissonBinomial 1.0.1

* Fixed a bug in the C++ helper function "norm_dpb" that could cause infinite
  loops (the function is invisible to the user, since it is only used in the
  C++ domain).
  

# PoissonBinomial 1.0.0

* Initial release
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
